The steps are listed and explained below. Always check for non-factory items added to the vehicle before doing any diagnosis. If the vehicle is equipped with these items, disconnect them to verify these add-on items are not the cause of the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Verify the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Verify any related symptoms. Do this by performing operational checks on components that are in the same circuit. Refer to the wiring diagrams.<br/>\n<br/>\n&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Analyze the symptoms. Use the wiring diagrams to determine what the circuit is doing, where the problem most likely is occurring and where the diagnosis will continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Isolate the problem area.<br/>\n<br/>\n&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Repair the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Verify proper operation. For this step check for proper operation of all items on the repaired circuit. Refer to the wiring diagrams.<br/>\n", "image": null, "fname": "21136/diagrams/VehicleSystems__DiagnosticAidsDiagrams__TroubleshootingWiringProblems.json"}
