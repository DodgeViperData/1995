When handling any component with this symbol, comply with the following procedures to reduce the possibility of electrostatic charge build-up on the body and inadvertent discharge into the component. If it is not known whether the part is ESD sensitive, assume that it is.<br/>\n&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Always touch a known good ground before handling the part. This should be repeated while handling the part, especially after sliding across a seat, sitting down from a standing position, or walking a distance.<br/>\n&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Avoid touching electrical terminals of the part, unless instructed to do so by a written procedure.<br/>\n&nbsp;3.&nbsp;When using a voltmeter, be sure to connect the ground lead first.<br/>\n&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Do not remove the part from its protective packing until it is time to install the part.<br/>\n&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Before removing the part from its package, ground the package to a known good ground on the vehicle.<br/>\n", "image": "21136/diagrams/VehicleSystems__DiagramInformationandInstructionsDiagrams__HowtoUseCompleteBodyandChassisDiagrams__ElectrostaticDischargeESDSensitiveDevices.png", "fname": "21136/diagrams/VehicleSystems__DiagramInformationandInstructionsDiagrams__HowtoUseCompleteBodyandChassisDiagrams__ElectrostaticDischargeESDSensitiveDevices.json"}
